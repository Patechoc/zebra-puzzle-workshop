* Completed Exercise 2.

Exercise 3: Reasoning 
===========================================

In this exercise we will:

1. Learn how a reasoner can infer facts from the ones we already know.
2. Run the existing model with different reasoning level "None" (Ex.3.1 in the code).
3. Run the existing model with different reasoning level "OWL" (Ex.3.2 in the code).
4. Is Bergen a Norwegian city?
   Well, we know it is. But does that pile of melted silicone under your fingertips know that?
5. What has to be done to make the reasoner infer that Bergen is a Norwegian city without explicitly declaring that? (Ex.3.3 in the code.)
6. Awesomesauce! Level up!


Hints:

1. For Ex.3.1 in the code, you can write the following for reasoning level "None":
            ontModel = ModelFactory.createOntologyModel(OntModelSpec.OWL_DL_MEM);
2. For Ex.3.2 in the code (reasoning level "OWL"), you will have to use a reasoning engine, e.g. Pellet:
            a. Create reasoner object
            b. Create inference model: 
                ModelFactory.createInfModel(...);
            c. Create ontology model based on inference model and the reasoner spec 
                (i.e. PelletReasonerFactory.THE_SPEC).
3. For Ex.3.3 in the code, you will need to extend TTL file with more facts. 
   You might want to give owl:intersectionOf a try.
